We can turn each letter into a picture, and then associate
something with each picture. We can then recite the alphabet in order, and recall the associations that we memorized. This will give us the ability to remember lists that are at least 26 items long. Now if you want to remember a list of things, you can associate each alphabet animal with each item in your list.
If you can recite the alphabet backwards, you can also recite the memorized list items backwards. You can create more than one alphabet peg list, by using different animals, objects, foods, names of celebrities, and more.
