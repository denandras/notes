## The Shaper System

> The Shaper System was developed by a Mnemonist [[Erol Ozvatan\|Erol Ozvatan]] with the initial thought of converting 2 digit numbers and The Alphabet letters from its outline shapes into images that has the impression of a lookalike shape & reflection.

- As an example; The image for “19” is an Elephant in the shaper system. This is because the number digits are seen with its outline shape, and reflects the impression of an Elephant with its “Back Tail”, “The Big Ear” and “The Trunk” of an Elephant that looks like “19”.
- Another example is “20” which is “Snail”. Again the number digit are seen by its outline shape, and reflects the impression of a “Snail” that looks like “20”.
- The Shaper System offers a variety of Methods for numbers memory. It can be used as a 1,2,3,4,5, and 6 digits PAO. Each method used in the correct order which can be visualised as a single scene on a single locus. These methods are explained in detail by Erol Ozvatan on his website at PAOLIST.com

## The Association System
[[Andi Bell\|Andi Bell]]

> One way to link numbers to images is to create associations between them.
> In general, every memorizer chooses their own images, because everyone's mind makes different kinds of associations.

- For example, the number 52 could be represented by a deck of playing cards, because a deck has 52 cards.
- The number 00 could be represented by a bicycle, because it looks like the wheels of a bicycle.
- The number 64 could be represented by the Beatles, because of their song, When I'm Sixty-four.
## The Major System

> The Major System is probably the most common number-memorization system in use. Though the history of the Major System goes back at least hundreds of years, its first publication in its modern form appears to have been written by [[Aimé Paris\|Aimé Paris]] in 1825.

> In the version of the Major System that we'll describe here, every possible two-digit number will be converted into an image by translating the digits into consonant sounds and then finding an image that fits those consonants.
