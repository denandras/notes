## The Shaper System

> The Shaper System was developed by a Mnemonist [[Erol Ozvatan\|Erol Ozvatan]] with the initial thought of converting 2 digit numbers and The Alphabet letters from its outline shapes into images that has the impression of a lookalike shape & reflection.

- As an example; The image for “19” is an Elephant in the shaper system. This is because the number digits are seen with its outline shape, and reflects the impression of an Elephant with its “Back Tail”, “The Big Ear” and “The Trunk” of an Elephant that looks like “19”.
- Another example is “20” which is “Snail”. Again the number digit are seen by its outline shape, and reflects the impression of a “Snail” that looks like “20”.
- The Shaper System offers a variety of Methods for numbers memory. It can be used as a 1,2,3,4,5, and 6 digits PAO. Each method used in the correct order which can be visualised as a single scene on a single locus. These methods are explained in detail by Erol Ozvatan on his website at PAOLIST.com
